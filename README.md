# Metering-anomaly-detection
本系统面向市场场景中的计量仪表异常检测需求，通过多维度视觉特征融合策略实现高精度监测。系统以视频流为输入，结合用户交互式标定与自动化分析技术，动态识别市场台秤区域的异常变化（如异物、其他菜品、工具异常等），并生成可视化报警结果。

This system is oriented to the needs of meter anomaly detection in market scenarios, and realizes high-precision monitoring through a multi-dimensional visual feature fusion strategy. The system uses the video stream as the input, combined with the user's interactive calibration and automatic analysis technology, to dynamically identify abnormal changes in the market scale area (such as foreign objects, other dishes, tool abnormalities, etc.), and generate visual alarm results.
